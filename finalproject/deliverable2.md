## Deliverable 2

In this image as you can see we had to install the Ubuntu server to get it up in running in order for us to start the process for the website

Here I am displaying all the information of the up and running sever. As well of showing the specs of the VM.

Displays the login for the server and the software we are running for the server.

In the middle of install Apache which allows scripts to turn into web pages.

Here you can see that we had just installed Apache and set up SSH for the server and had saved the snapshot.

We end up going into our regular vm machine and making sure ssh is set up and ready to go so we can start making sure our own website is up and running.

Lastly we enabled virtual host so that way we can set up our sample site. Every time we search up our ip address it will display the sample site.

Here I am checking to make sure that Apache is running smoothly and the website is up and running.

As you can see the website is fully functional and displays whats to come.
