## Key Terms

**Definitions of the following terms**

* File system: The way files are stored and organized to simplify access to data.

* Current directory: The directory where you are at the moment.

* Parent directory: You are always working inside a particular directory and you can move forward a subdirectory or backwards to the previous directory. 

* The difference between your home directory and the home directory: your Home directory is a user of the system and consists of individual files. The home directory is the one that the system has created. 

* Pathname: Indicates the location of the file in the filesystem (like an address).

* Relative path: The location of a file starting from the current working directory or a directory that is located inside the current working directory.

* Absolute path: The location of a file starting a the root of the file system

* The commands are used for navigating the filesystem.
 * pwd
* cd
* ls
